## Backend Focused project

So it's ugly looking, but playing around with React-Redux

This repo was mainly built to play around with some testing with React-Redux. This app has integration tests that verify signing in and out, plus fetching comments. Unit tests for each component and action.

The functionality of the app is basically akin to a comment board where users can sign in and fetch comments/post new comments. They are anonymous and the app currently includes a random assortment that will populate for testing purposes.
